- Part1. Train VGG16 with quantization-aware training (10%)
- 
Done
- Part2. Complete RTL core design connecting the following blocks: (5%)
- 
Done
- Part3. Test bench generation to run following stages: (20%)
- 
Done
- Part4. Mapping on FPGA (Cyclone IV GX EP4CGX150DF31I7AD)  (10%)
- 
Done, except for TOPs/s computation 
- Part5. Weight-stationary and output stationary reconfigurable PE (20%)

TODO
- Part6. +alpha (20% + 5% bonus)

TODO

Possible methods:
1. read/write FIFO concurrently
2. Resnet implementation
3. Mixed unstructured and structured pruning
4. ...
